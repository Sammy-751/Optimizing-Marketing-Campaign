# Optimizing Market Campaigns: Predicting Term Deposit Subscriptions

## ğŸ“Œ Overview
The bank runs large-scale phone campaigns to promote term deposits. However, only a small fraction of customers subscribe. This project builds a predictive model to help the marketing team better target potential customers, reduce unnecessary calls, and increase the effectiveness of their campaigns.

## ğŸ§  Business and Data Understanding

**Stakeholders**: Marketing managers and campaign strategists.

**Dataset**: Contains customer profiles, campaign interaction details, and outcomes.

**Business Questions**:
1. What characteristics drive subscription?
2. Can we reduce wasted calls?
3. Can we predict customer responses?

## ğŸ”¬ Modeling

- Logistic Regression and Decision Tree were used.
- Data preprocessing included encoding and scaling.
- SMOTE addressed class imbalance.
- Features used: `duration`, `month`, `previous contact`, `poutcome`, and others.

## ğŸ“ˆ Evaluation

| Metric       | Logistic Regression | Decision Tree |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Accuracy     | 85%                 | 87%            |
| ROC AUC      | 0.89                | 0.82           |
| Precision    | 42%                 | 46%            |
| Recall       | 78%                 | 57%            |

## ğŸ’¡ Key Insights

- Clients with past successful outcomes â†’ 9x more likely to say yes.
- March and October had highest conversion rates.
- Longer calls correlated strongly with positive outcomes.

## âœ… Conclusion

Classification helped identify high-potential customers. The model enables:
- Cost reduction in marketing
- Better targeting
- Higher ROI

## ğŸ“Œ Recommendations

- Prioritize calling clients with:
  - Past successful contact
  - Higher predicted probability scores
  - Interaction in peak months

- Use probability thresholds and lift charts to guide segmentation.
