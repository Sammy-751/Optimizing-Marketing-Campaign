# Optimizing Market Campaigns: Predicting Term Deposit Subscriptions

## ğŸ“Œ Overview
The bank runs large-scale phone campaigns to promote term deposits. However, only a small fraction of customers subscribe. This project builds a predictive model to help the marketing team better target potential customers, reduce unnecessary calls, and increase the effectiveness of their campaigns.

## ğŸ§  Business and Data Understanding

**Stakeholders**: Marketing managers and campaign strategists aiming to increase ROI on telemarketing efforts.

**Dataset**: The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. 


### Business Questions:
1. What customer and campaign characteristics most influence subscription?
2. Can we use these insights to prioritize and reduce unnecessary outreach?
3. Can we accurately predict who will subscribe to better guide campaign planning?

## ğŸ”¬ Modeling

- Logistic Regression and Decision Tree were used.
- Data preprocessing included encoding and scaling.
- SMOTE addressed class imbalance.
- Features used: `duration`, `month`, `previous contact`, `poutcome`, and others.

## ğŸ’¡ Key Insights

- Clients with past successful outcomes â†’ 9x more likely to say yes.
- March and October had highest conversion rates.
- Longer calls correlated strongly with positive outcomes.

## âœ… Conclusion

Classification helped identify high-potential customers. The model enables:
- Cost reduction in marketing
- Better targeting
- Higher ROI

## ğŸ“Œ Recommendations

- Prioritize calling clients with:
  - Past successful contact
  - Higher predicted probability scores
  - Interaction in peak months

- Use probability thresholds and lift charts to guide segmentation.
